# Todo Application

###
This application ha been developed as a school project, 1dv610, and its focus has been to create an Authentication application
together with a Todo application that is written according to MVC pattern. In the application only PHP has been used.

# Configure application
To run the application as your own, some steps are required. These needs to be made for 
the Authentication application, and also the Todo application. I assume you have some knowledge of php and know how to run a local setup
with a phpmyadmin table.


## 1. Configure Local settings

## 2. Configure Production settings

## 3. You also have to create your databases and populate them with tables.
Two tables are needed. One named "users" and one named "todos".
